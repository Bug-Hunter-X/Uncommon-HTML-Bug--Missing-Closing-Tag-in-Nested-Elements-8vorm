# Uncommon HTML Bug: Missing Closing Tag in Nested Elements

This repository demonstrates a subtle HTML bug caused by a missing closing tag within nested elements.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in browsers and is harder to spot than typical syntax errors.

The `bug.html` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected code.

**Bug Description:**

The issue lies in the nested `<span>` element; its closing tag is missing. This missing tag can cause the browser to incorrectly interpret the structure of the HTML, potentially affecting the layout and rendering of the subsequent content.  While some browsers might attempt to recover, the behavior is not standardized and can vary across browsers.

**How to Reproduce:**

1. Open `bug.html` in your web browser.
2. Observe the layout and rendering of the paragraphs and the span element.
3. Compare it to the corrected version in `bugSolution.html`.

**Solution:**

Always ensure that all opening tags have corresponding closing tags. The solution, found in `bugSolution.html`, simply adds the missing closing tag `</span>` to correct the HTML structure.
